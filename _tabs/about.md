Welcome to my data science website! I am thrilled to share my journey and expertise with you.

I hold a Master of Applied Science (M.A.Sc.) degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering, where my research focused on the synthesis of analog filters using evolutionary algorithms. This academic experience honed my analytical and problem-solving skills, providing a solid foundation in engineering principles and research methodologies.

Following my master's degree, I ventured into the field of automation and robotics. During this time, I had the opportunity to work with a variety of industrial automation systems. This role allowed me to apply my engineering knowledge practically, enhancing my understanding of automation technologies and their applications in real-world scenarios.

Currently, I am passionately pursuing a career in Data Science. My journey in this field has been enriched by numerous projects where I have utilized diverse data science tools and cloud platforms. These projects have equipped me with a broad spectrum of skills, from data analysis and machine learning to data visualization and cloud computing.

I am continuously seeking opportunities to apply my knowledge and skills in data science and engineering positions. My goal is to contribute to innovative projects that leverage data to drive impactful decisions and solutions.

Thank you for visiting my site. Please feel free to explore my projects and reach out if you have any questions or opportunities to discuss.
